# AmExpert-2021-PyCaret üè¶

## Task üíº
Competetion conducted by American Express on [HackerEarth Platform](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/amexpert-code-lab/).
We are given relevant information about the customers of a company. And we're required to build a Machine Learning Model that can predict if there will be Credit Card Defaulters.

## Dataset üìö

## Evaluation Metrics üíØ
**Score:** 100 * (metrics.f1_score(actual, predicted, average='macro'))

## ML Library: PyCaret üî•
* PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that speeds up the experiment cycle exponentially and makes you more productive.

* In comparison with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and few more.

* The design and simplicity of PyCaret are inspired by the emerging role of citizen data scientists, a term first used by Gartner. Citizen Data Scientists are power users who can perform both simple and moderately sophisticated analytical tasks that would previously have required more technical expertise.
